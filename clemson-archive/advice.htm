Evidently, many of you are confused about what it means to be a graduate
student. This message may not apply to all, but I know
it applies to a lot of you based on the fact that only three people
are here this morning.

A graduate student is supposed to work long hours without much
sleep.

A graduate student should look tired.

A graduate student never takes vacations.

A graduate student works all the time.

A graduate student works harder than the Advisor and is more
productive than the Advisor. This is where a lot you are confused. Many of
you think the Advisor is supposed to do all of the work.
