<h3>Chaos - Making of a New Science. James Gleick</h3>
<h4>Notes from the book</h4>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>
<b>Chapter 1: The Butterfly Effect</b><br>
The notion that a butterfly stirring the air today in Peking can transform storm 
systems next month in New York - non-linear systems that are highly sensitive to 
initial conditions. Similar behavior exhibited by pendulums - eqn: 
<i>d<sup>2</sup>&Oslash;/dt<sup>2</sup> + (k/m)d&Oslash;/dt + (g/l)sin(&Oslash;) = (1/ml<sup>2</sup>)T</i>
- period of a pendulum not independant of its amplitude of oscillation because of the non-linearity introduced by sin(&Oslash;). 
The behavior depends on intial angle &Oslash;.
</p>

<p>
Nonlinearity - the act of playing the game has a way of changing the rules - how friction on a moving body 
depends on speed and how speed in turn depends on friction. Example of a highly non-linear governing eqn: 
The Navier-Stokes eqn in fluid dynamics. Systems that never really reach a steady state - the Lorenzian 
waterwheel whose spin can reverse many times, never settling down to a steady state 
and never repeating itself in a predictable pattern. A small perturbance input may not blow up 
the system but the states may keep changing in unique ways within bounds - the Lorenzian Attracter. 
The behavior is chaotic, but there is still some strange sense of order and pattern - Refer the paper 
"Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow", Journal of Atmospheric Sciences 20 (1963), pp. 130-41.
</p>
<p>
As an aside, 'order in chaos' is something that Michael Crichton talks about in the 'Jurassic Park'. Life exists 
at the edge of chaos....a slight disturbance either way (in the form of behavioral changes, disturbance in the 
delicate balance of the eco-system) can wipe out a species.
</p>

<p>
<b>Chapter 2: Revolution</b><br>
Thomas S Kuhn's argument (1962) - Science progresses not by accretion of knowledge (each discovery adding to the 
last) or by emergence of new theories when experimental facts require them. Science progresses due to unorthodox 
works that revolutionize the way an object of study is looked at. Revolutions occur when fundamental assumptions 
keeping current theories alive are questioned. By adopting the current state-of-the-art (in terminology, mathematical 
technique) as the truth, a scientist can take the next step resulting in incremental progress but may not create a 
revolution, since unconsciously he had given up much freedom to question the foundation of his science. A revolution 
often has interdesciplinary character - central discoveries often coming from people straying outside the normal 
bounds of their specialties. Shallow ideas can be assimilated; ideas that require people to re-organize their picture 
of the world provoke hostility. Revolutions do not come peacemeal - one account of nature replaces another.  
</p>

<p>
For centuries search for regularity in experiment has been fundamental. Small non-linearities were easy to disregard. 
If a chemist finds two substances in a constant proportion of 2.001 one day, 2.003 the next day and 1.998 the day after, 
he would be a fool not to look for a theory that would explain a perfect two-to-one ratio.
</p>

<p>
Non-linear systems usually unsolvable and the occurance of non-linearity in a system is not an exception - something that 
a serious researcher must accept. A damped driven system (playground swing) can remain within bounded states, but 
may never settle down to a steady state and never exactly repeat a pattern of states that came before. Disorderly behavior 
of simple systems act as 'creative' process. The microscopic pieces (fundamental physics and mechanisms) could be perfectly 
clear, but the macroscopic behavior (state of the system in the long term) could remain a mystery. 
The 'linear system theory' way of looking at things locally - isolating the mechanisms and then adding them together - was 
beginning to break down. An unexpected result from an experiment on a system modelled as a linear system may not be an 
experimental error - a deterministic system can produce much more than just periodic behavior. A complex system can give 
rise to turbulance and coherence at the same time.
</p>

<p>
Topology - branch of methematics studying the properties that remain unchanged when shapes are deformed by twisting or stretching 
or squeezing. Stability in the sense of Smale (Stephen Smale, UCBK) - A system can behave erratically, but the erratic behavior 
cannot be 'stable'. Chaos and instability are not the same. Add noise to a complex system, stir it up, interfere with it's motion, 
and then when everything is settled down, the transients dying away, the system could return to the same peculiar pattern of 
irregularity as before - a robust system locally unpredictable but globally stable.

<b>Chapter 3: Life's Ups and Downs</b><br>

Ecology - the relation of plants and living creatures to each other and to their environment, or the study of this 
[Oxford Advanced Learner's dictionary]. - mathematical treatment of populations as dynamical systems, with realization that 
mathematical models are only thin approximations of reality. Physicists and pure mathematicians used to consider irregular behavior 
from simple regular equations interesting oddities; to an ecologist that often conveyed something deep about the system under study.  
</p>

<p>
A simple population growth equation - the logistic nonlinear equation: <code><b>x<sub>next</sub> = rx(1-x)</b></code>, <code>r</code> 
represents rate of growth, <code>(1-x)</code> keeps the growth rate within bounds since as <code>x</code> increases, <code>(1-x)</code> 
decreases. This eqn. is similar to those for physical systems where the term <code>r</code> represents amount of heating, or friction, 
i.e. the amount of non-linearity. For lower values of <code>r</code>, the output stabilizes to some low value, for higher values 
they stabilize to a higher value; for very high values, the output gets chaotic with no sight of equilibrium.
</p>

Landmark paper: James Yorke, "Period Three Implies Chaos", American Mathematical Monthly 82 (1975), pp. 985-92. - Bifurcation diagrams - 
little spikes of order within chaos. Modelling of biological systems using simple chaotic models. - Unpredictability of system behavior 
(a diseased population) in the presence of sudden perturbation (program of inoculation): naive intuition suggests that the system will 
change smoothly in the desired direction. But in reality huge oscillations can occur in its path to equilibrium - example: sharp short-term 
rise in rubella during an anti-rubella inoculation program in Britain.
</p>

<p>
Simple nonlinear systems do not necessarily have simple dynamical behavior - Robert M. May, "Simple Mathematical Models with very Complicated 
Dynamics", Nature, 1976, p. 459.
</p>

<p>
<b>Chapter 4: A Geometry of Nature</b><br>
The standard model for random variation, the bell-shaped gaussian distribution does not define all randomness in nature. 
Complexity in nature may neither be random nor accidental. Traditional shapes of geometry, lines and planes, are a powerful 
abstraction to reality inspired by a powerful philosophy of platonic harmony. But in nature clouds aren't circles and 
mountains aren't cones. The need for a new kind of geometry that mirrors a universe rough, not rounded, scabrous, not smooth.
</p>

<p>
The discovery that a numerical result of measurement should depend on the relation of object to the observer (relativity) - 
The measurement of length of the coastline depends on the length of the ruler. Measurement depends on (distance)scale of 
observation. Estimation of the length of the coastline as provided by a satellite would be a smaller guess than that 
from an observer trying to walk its coves and beaches, who will make a smaller guess in turn than a snail negotiating every 
pebble.
</p>
  
<p>
Fractality (degree of roughness/irregularity) as a dimension of measurement. If the fractal dimension of a surface is 
constant, its degree of roughness is the same at all levels of magnification. Benoit Mandelbrot and his analysis of 
telephone line transmission errors as <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CantorSet.html">cantor sets</a> arranged 
in time. The <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KochSnowflake.html">Koch curve</a>, an infinitely long line 
surrounding a finite area. Other interesting 'natural' shapes - Peano curve and 
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SierpinskiSieve.html">Sierpinski carpets</a> whose complexity if extended without 
limit will have infinite surface area but zero volumne. The trusses of the Eiffel tower is a good approximation of the 
Sierpinski sieve - a structure with less weight without compromising structural strength.
</p>

<p>
Applications of fractal geometry - nonlinear dynamics, study of surfaces in contact (tire and road, machine parts). 
Nature of branching of blood vessels from aorta to capillaries (large surface area in finite volume), bronchial branching, 
urinary collection system are all fractal in design. Fractals help create photorealistic images of landscapes in 
computer graphics. A geometrical shape has a scale and a characteristic size. To Mandelbrot, art that satisfies 
lacks scale, in the sense that it contains important elements in all scales like an intricate sculpture. 
The reason why we find beautiful the silhoutte of a storm-bent leafless tree against an evening sky in winter, 
as opposed to the silhoutte of a building.
