<p>As a group, this was our first trip together, and we had been planning on doing something of this sort for a really long time. But it was a year before Ram could finish cataloging 
all the exotic insects in the sahara desert (he works on a project for the National Geographic), and sudhir could finish his ground-breaking research on RF transmitter design (it still doesn't work). My research was in a state of coma anyway. So it was the right time for the trip. 
<!--For those of you who are still wondering what the whole experiance was like, I will let Sameer's lines do the talking!....

Title- Unknown

On the night after the trip,
I felt I had lost all grip, 
I lay on my bed,
Eyes so red!

But I could not sleep,
Even after counting the sheep.

A question kept looping inside:
“Was it worth the cramping ride?”
“What did I gain,
Besides the body pain?”

Then an angel mockingly spoke.
“Oh! My! Is that a joke?
Think; think a little more,
And you will find yourself at the right door”

The answer to me at midnight came,
When I thought of the cricket game.
With you guys around,
On the Elkmont Camping Ground.


Never before have I kept rear,
While thinking about a lurking bear!

Guys, we make a dream team,
Together we can whip the cream!

As the last peg into the ground went,
Our joyous cry, the air rent.
We were all dun,
Ready for some real fun!

And Oh! The long driving stretch,
Got me a caricature sketch.
He was done with my hair,
Before I settled into the chair.

Then the fire began to glow,
And lifted our spirits, So low,
Out leapt the flame,
While we played the ‘Taboo’ game.

Then some of us slept,
But the flames still leapt.



Beware! Us the forests surround,
IN these mountains, ghosts abound.
A crackling fire on a rugged terrain,
Could draw their ire and murrain.

What happened after, felt like a dream,
Happening somewhere in the subconscious stream.
But my lips are sealed; I am by the honor code bound,
Pledged before the eternal fire on that holy ground.

Thank you friends for your frank words,
And for focussing on some dark worlds.
That night, I looked at my shadow and wept,
And still the red flames leapt.

Then it was seven in the morning,
I was for some warmth yearning,
But not a single log was burning,
The flames were now all gone, as if in mourning.

Soon we were all packed,
The cold really had us jacked.




As we bid Adieu to the camp, I thought:
“Today was our turn. 
Shall we ever return?”
Such was the joy the trip to me brought.

“Rafting is closed.” we were told,
We felt left out. Stone cold!

But then we went hiking, 
Which was pretty much to my liking,

I would refuse all the bimbos in Fyke,
For that Mingo hike!

But then, What about the body pain?
Who cares, I would fain do it again,
Only if it does not rain!

When tomorrow we go our separate wayz,
Each searching his way in the maze,
These memories I will always cherish,
Even after I perish!




Whenever I pack my camping gear,
And the strains of Dil Chahta Hai fill the air,
I will ever fondly remember the bear,
And grin; From Ear to Ear!!
