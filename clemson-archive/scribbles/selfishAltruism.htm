<h3>Reciprocal Altruism</h3>

<div style="text-align:justify;">
<P>Altruistic acts may be beneficial if they are reciprocated leading to mutual benefit(biologist Robert Trivers). This is termed <B>reciprocal altruism</B>. 
</p>

<P>However, there is a serious problem with this: If one individual increases in fitness due to the action of a non-related conspecific 
it might maximise its fitness by not reciprocating.  <B>Axelrod & Hamilton (1981)</B> noticed that this problem was identical to a model 
from economics known as the <B>prisoners dilemma</B> used to describe co-operation between trading partners.
</P>

<P>Co-operation and reciprocal altruism can be thought of two ends of the same continuum. In the case of co-operation the altruistic acts 
take place at the same time, in the case of reciprocal altruism they take place sequentially. The problem is exactly the same, however, 
to behave altruistically or take the other individual's good-will and run.

<h4>The Prisoners' Dilemma</h4>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<P>The prisoners' dilemma model is based on a hypothetical situation involving two miscreants: these two work together have 
been taken in by the police and are interviewed in separate cells.  Each criminal has two possible strategies available to him; 
either co-operate with the other criminal and refuse to implicate him in the robbery or to defect and implicate the other criminal 
for a reward.  Therefore there are four possible payoffs that can be summarised in a 2x2 matrix:

</TABLE>

<p><B>The problem is this:</B> if they both defect they will both get the harshest penalty. If they both co-operate they will get a reward 
but it will not be as large as the one they would get if one defected and the other one co-operated. So, there is always a short term advantage 
to defection. This model has been used as a paradigm for behavioural interactions between non-related individuals because the relative pay-offs 
would seem to be the same.  We would predict that if the interaction occurred just one time then it would always pay to defect because there 
would be no opportunities for your altruism to be reciprocated. However, the situation is more difficult to determine in situations where there 
are repeated interactions.  This is known as the itterated prisoners dilemma.

<h4>The Iterated Prisoners Dilemma</h4>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<P><B>Axelrod and Hamilton</B> wanted to find out what the best (<B>E</B>volutionarily <B>S</B>table <B>S</B>trategy or <B>ESS</B>) was for 
winning the iterated prisoners dilemma game. They used the following pay-offs and allowed several strategies to compete against each other 
within a computer simulation. The winning strategy was one of the simplest which is known as <B>tit-for-tat</B>.</P>

<P><B>Tit-for-tat</B> = co-operate on the first interaction and then do whatever the opponent did in the last interaction.</P>

<P>If the prisoners'dilemma (PD) is a good model of altruistic interactions between non-relatives we can then go on to make 
predictions about what circumstances we would expect reciprocal altruism to evolve based on the assumptions of the iterated PD model:</P>

<P>The two main assumptions of Prisoners Dilemma model are:</P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Repeated interactions and perfect memory</B>
<P>Reciprocal altruism should occur in organisms which are relatively long lived with fairly sophisticated brains since it is vital to remember what occurred that last time an interaction took place. Since memory in most animals is not perfect the interactions should ideally occur on a relatively short time scale.</P>

<LI><B>Probability of interactions ending is small and constant</B>
<P>In the computer tournament there was a small constant probability that each interaction would be the last.  If it was possible to know that an interaction would not occur again it would always pay to defect. In the real world old age and illness may be enough to prevent reciprocation taking place. For the probability of the interaction to be small the participants must live close by, but must be unrelated, or else the altruism could be explained by kin selection.</P>
</OL>

<P><B>Are there any real examples of reciprocal altruism in the field?</B></P>

<P><B><u>Vampire Bats</u></b></P>
<P><B>Wilkinson (1984) </B>noticed that vampire bats will often give unsuccessful unrelated individuals a blood meal at the end of the night by regurgitating blood. Wilkinson was able to demonstrate that individuals were more likely to feed bats that had fed them before than other bats.</P>

<P><B><u>Olive Baboons</u></B></P>
<P><B>Packer</B> found that juvenile male baboons would often form coalitions to cuckold the alpha male in the group. One of the juveniles would distract the alpha male while the other juvenile would minister to the females in heat. This would then be reciprocated. The results of this study have been severely criticised because the number of observations is so low.</P>

<P><B><u>Sticklebacks</u></B></P>
<P><B>Millinski</B> found that sticklebacks would approach a model of a predator in a tit-for-tat manner before retreating rapidly. The purpose of this predator inspection is not definitely known but it may be to assess the motivational state of the predator or even to identify whether it is a predator at all.</P>

<P><B><U>Reciprocal Altruism in Humans</U></B></P>
<P>At a basic level reciprocal altruism is ubiquitous in interactions between non-relatives. To illustrate this I choose a trivial example - but one that will hopefully strike a cord. Imagine a group of colleagues down the Pub - all of whom earn a similar amount of money. 1 individual never buys a round but all the others do. Sooner or later the defector will be weeded out or the system of round buying will collapse. The same is true of present giving, money lending and no end of other human interactions that occur on a day to day level.</P>
<p>Here is another slightly unrelated but interesting example from the mathematician John Nash. At the time, Economics was most influenced by Adam Smith who stated "In competition, individual ambition serves the common good."  Nash's bargaining theories of bargaining equilibrium and governing dynamics replaced this idea.  His theory was explained in the movie as “The maximum benefit to a group can be realized if each individual works for his own benefit and the group's.”  This was developed in a bar scene when Nash and his 3 colleagues see a statuesque blonde come in with 4, slightly less beautiful, women.  As his colleagues debated over who could get the blonde, Nash played out 3 scenarios.  In scenario 1, the four of them try to get the blonde and only end up blocking each other.  In scenario 2, after being blocked by the blonde, they go for the four women and are rejected because “no one wants to be thought of as second best."  In scenario 3, the four men ignore the blonde and go after the 4 women.  In this way, Nash concludes, “We all get laid.” which contradicts the classical theory that individual's should compete for the common good. 
<p>Also, the following is another interesting theory on similar lines :<br>
