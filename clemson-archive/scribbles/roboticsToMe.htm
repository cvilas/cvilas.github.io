<h3>Why Robotics is important to me</h3><br>

<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>
I often wondered why my grandmother knows more than me about nature - the seasons, the position of stars, the wildlife around us. 
She hardly had any formal education worth talking about and I am a Master's student, on my way to a PhD. Our ancestors subsisted on 
nature, lived by it and lived in harmony with it and hence developed an intricate relationship it, with a sense of respect for 
everything that belonged to nature. Sitting in our windowless offices writing computer code, we have lost that beautiful relationship. 
We do not care much about using our natural resources intelligently. We live in houses that require lighting even when sunlight is plenty, 
breathing artificial re-circulated air all day long. Our education is too narrow, focussing mostly on things that we do not even require for our survival. 
For example with a few hours of reading I can put together a Beowulf cluster but If I were to be dropped deep in the Amazon, I would probably 
find myself struggling to survive, eventhough I would have been in the midst of plenty.

I see the study of robotics as a way to earn back that relationship with nature and life around us. As a good roboticist, I need to understand 
not only how to build electronic circuits and machine mechanical parts, but I also need to understand animal behavior, psychology, that strange 
thing we call intelligence and our sensory-motor skills. While we can make machines that can beat a human being in chess, we have none that can 
walk, talk or see like us; let alone the capability to understand the surroundings like we do. This is the holy grail of research in robotics 
and it is taking us closer to understanding the mysteries in nature and in ourselves. In short, research in robotics is now a quest to understand 
the complexity of life and replicate their efficiency in thinking machines.
