This document provides a general outline of the procedure that one must follow while making 
purchases for the CRB group. Our purchases are billed to accounts managed by various departments 
(ECE, ME, MSE, etc) and each department follows its own procedures. If you are ordering equipment 
for the first time, please meet the administrative assistant who manages the department accounts 
and get to know the procedure before you go ahead with the purchase. You can also ask 
<a href="http://ece.clemson.edu/crb/students/psetlur/resume.htm">Pradeep</a> or 
<a href="http://ece.clemson.edu/crb/students/vilas">Vilas</a> if they are around. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>Almost all purchases we make are through departmental Purchase Orders (PO). <br><br>
<li>Get quotations for the items you wish to purchase from the sellers. Request them to
	include rough estimates for shipping charges and taxes.<br><br>
<li>All purchases are charged to a particular account number. Get to know the account number and the department 
	managing that account. The purchase order will also need a PO number. Mail the accounts assistant 
	with details of the purchase and she will give you the PO number.<br><br>
<li>All heavy purchases that exceed a few hundred dollars are taken care of by the adminstrative assistant in 
	the department managing the account. You will need to write a requisition letter and submit 
	it with the accounts assistant. Meet the accounts assistant for more information on this.<br><br>
<li>Follow any additional department procedures while placing an order. Each department has its own procedures. For example,
	when making purchases on accounts managed by the ECE department, members of CRB group are allowed to post a PO by themselves 
	as long	as it does not exceed purchases for over $1500. Always clarify these details with Vilas or Pradeep.<br><br>
<li>When a PO is sent, enter the details in the CRB accounts database. There is a separate spreadsheet for each account 
	number. <br><br>
<li>Once the invoice is received, make corrections to this spreadsheet to reflect additional charges for shipping, 
	etc. Also include the date when the payment was cleared for the purchase.<br><br>
<li>Keep a copy of the packing slip for future reference. The accounts assistant may also need a copy 
	of the packing slip for her reference. <br><br>
<li>If you have any questions or if you are unsure of something, please ask and clarify. This will avoid any administrative 
	nightmares for the accounts assistant. She already has enough on her hands.<br><br>
</ul>

<b>Some useful vendor specific information</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Buy.com</b>: There is no phone number on their website. Use 949-389-2311 to get information about an order. Ask them to fax you a 
copy of the invoice because they usually do not send the invoice to the accounts assistant.
