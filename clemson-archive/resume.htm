   <b>Robotics and Mechatronics Laboratory, Clemson University, Clemson, SC: Graduate Research Assistant August 2000 - current:</b><br>
	 <ul>
	  <li><i>Vision-based guidance, navigation and control strategies for autonomous vehicles</i>: Designed 
	  vision-in-the-loop nonlinear control strategies aimed towards autonomous operation of unmanned 
	  aerial vehicles (UAVs).
	  <li><i>Vision-based motion estimation and 3D reconstruction</i>: Designed and implemented a 
	  complete prototype of a nonlinear estimator for identification of velocity and structure of 
	  targets in the field of view of a monocular camera. Implementation involved the development 
	  of algorithms for nonlinear estimator, image processing, video processing, and computer vision, 
	  the test bed, and an OpenGL based virtual scene viewer for the reconstructed environment.
