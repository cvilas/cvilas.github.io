roars with approximately 80,000 spectators during the home game
with Georgia Tech.</font></font></b>

<p><font face="Berlin Sans FB">People here are crazy about football, like
the way we Indians are crazy about cricket.
<br>Fall is also the football season, and every
game is an occasion for celebration.</font>

real early if you need&nbsp; parking space.</font></font></b>

<p><font face="Berlin Sans FB">I normally work at the parking lot 7 during
these games. It doesn’t get to be as boring as
<br>other student police positions because
there are a lot of people around here to talk to,
<br>and this is also one of the most scenic
places within the university. I get to spend most
<br>of my time reading or talking to people.
It is particularly interesting talking to some of
<br>the old-timers, people who have once been
students of this university.</font>

Well almost. Policemen have a tough time, especially after the game regulating
the traffic at downtown.</font></font></b>
