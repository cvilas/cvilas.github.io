	In this work, we present a strategy for an autonomous landing maneuver for 
	an underactuated, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using position information 
	obtained from a single monocular on-board camera. Although the UAV is 
	underactuated in translational control inputs (i.e., a lift force can only 
	be produced), the proposed controller is shown to achieve globally uniform 
	ultimate boundedness (GUUB) in position regulation error during the landing 
	approach. The proposed vision-based control algorithm is built upon 
	homography-based techniques and Lyapunov design methods.
