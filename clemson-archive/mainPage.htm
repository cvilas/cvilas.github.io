<b>PUNCH AND JUDY TO THEIR AUDIENCE</b><br>
<br>
Our puppets strings are hard to see,<br>
So we perceive ourselves as free,<br>
Convinced that no mere objects could<br>
Behave in terms of bad and good.<br>
<br>
To you, we mannequins seem less<br>
than live, because our consciousness<br>
is that of dummies, made to sit<br>
on laps of gods and mouth their wit;<br>
<br>
Are you, our transcendental gods,<br>
likewise dangled from your rods,<br>
and need, to show spontaneous charm,<br>
some higher god's inserted arm?<br>
<br>
We seem to form a nested set,<br>
With each the next one's marionette,<br>
Who, if you asked him, would insist,<br>
that he's the last ventriloquist.<br>
<br>
