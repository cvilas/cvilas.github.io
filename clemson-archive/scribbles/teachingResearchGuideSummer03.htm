<p>
These are some guidelines for me to follow during my years as a PhD student. 
This document will slowly evolve into my first Research and Teaching statement as 
my views evolve with experiance as a researcher and instructor.

<p>
<b>Research:</b><br>
Inventions that aren't fancy innovations that contribute to luxury have a deeper 
impact on quality of human life. For example, the application of strong but light 
fiber reinforced plastic, used to make missile nose cones, in designing light weight Floor 
Reaction Orthosis for polio infected patients is a worthy invention. In comparison 
a remote controlled car door opener is not. Being in an advanced and highly interdesciplinary 
technological field, I am among the few trained to device solutions to problems by 
analyzing it from many different perspectives. As a researcher I should make sure that 
a fair share of my intellectual capacity and talents should contribute towards solving 
such problems with far reaching consequences, besides doing all the 'cool' things that 
we normally do.  

<p>
<b>Personal development as a researcher:</b><br>
My primary objective in the next couple of years will be to develop expertise in various 
speciality areas. The following will guide me to this end:
<ul>
<li>I will provide a <i>weekly update</i> of progress and failures in work to my advisors. This will make sure that I am 
progressing in the right direction. I will take advantage of their expertise by seeking help and criticism of my work 
whenever needed.
<li>I will <i>avoid re-inventing</i> the wheel. If an expertise for a particular technique I am trying to use 
in my research is already available among colleagues and faculty, I will make use of it. This will save time.
<li>I will <i>openly share</i> ideas with others in the research community. Engineers and scientists 
like to share. This accelerates learning through peer reviews. In return I can get other's perspective on 
a problem I am trying to tackle, or I might learn of a spinoff application of my work that I had 
no idea about. This will also help me become a part of the research community and stay 
current in my area. The number of contacts and friends I make through such a symbiotic relationship 
will be an additional asset.
<li>I will be <i>proactive in my approach</i> to learning. I will take tough courses that challenge my 
mental capacity, and do more than minimum required or expected to obtain a PhD degree. I will cultivate 
skills and learning in broad areas that will help make me competant not only in technical 
areas that require hardcore engineering skills but also in non-technical areas such as time, people 
and projects management.
<li>I will set a goal to have atleast one first authored research paper for all major conferences in robotics every year.
<li>I will look for <i>opportunities to collaborate</i> with researchers in other universities 
in USA and other countries, especially India.
<li>Once I am out of school the learning opportunities found in an academic environment 
may not be available anymore. I will work on individual projects and take courses that include 
projects as a component. I will make use of this period to <i>build personal 
value and an asset base</i> by cultivating contacts with experts in my area through conferences 
and newsgroups, and by co-authoring papers with researchers from different but possibly related 
focus areas. This will help me steer myself from the position of a follower into the position 
of a project leader who has the ability to sustain joint research efforts with many people. 
</ul>

<p>
<b>Possible PhD research themes</b><br>
<ol>
<li>Development and application of advanced machine vision techniques in controls and robotics
<li>Application of advanced mathematical techniques to computer vision, robotics and control.
<li>Control of Autonomous and underactuated systems. (wheeled robots, spacecrafts, missiles)
</ol> 

<p>
<b>Guidelines for Teaching:</b>
<ul>
<li>Incorporate latest research findings into the class, beyond what the textbook provides.
<li>Include porjects as assignments. These projects should be oriented at applications or clarifying the 
concepts learnt.
<li>Model lectures as a form of guided conversation with open class participation.
<li>Develop analytical and qualitative skills by incorporating practical assignments that reflect reality, 
and through use of both technical literature and science fiction. For example, take a situation 
or a concept from a science fiction movie (Trinity breaking into the computer system to shut 
power to a city in the movie 'The Matrix') and analyze how it could be done in the real world. A student 
is not expected to remember the equations taught in a class forever. Emphasis 
should be on training the mind to approach a challenging problem by breaking it into simpler manageable units.
<li>Guide. Do not spoonfeed. Show how to look for information.
<li>Set standards and benchmarks. Let the class be known that the purpose of a benchmark is to surpass it, not equal it.
<li>Make the process a learning experiance for both the teacher and the students. Work as a team.
</ul>
