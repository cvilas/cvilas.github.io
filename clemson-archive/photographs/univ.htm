Thomas Green Clemson, the University's founder, was born in Philadelphia and educated in the United States and 
France. He was a champion of formal scientific education and had a lifelong interest in agricultural affairs and 
farming.
</p>


<p>
He came to the Foothills of South Carolina when, in 1838, he married Anna Maria Calhoun, daughter of South 
Carolina's famous statesman, John C. Calhoun.
</p>

<p>
In the post-Civil War days of 1865, Thomas Clemson looked upon a South that lay in economic ruin, once remarking 
that "this country is in wretched condition, no money and nothing to sell. Everyone is ruined, and those that can 
are leaving."
</p>

<p>
When Thomas Clemson died on April 6, 1888, it set in motion a series of events that marked the start of a new era 
in higher education in the state of South Carolina. Mr. Clemson left most of his estate to be used to establish a 
college that would teach scientific agriculture and the mechanical arts to the young people of South Carolina.
</p>

<p>
In his will, he bequeathed the Fort Hill plantation and a considerable sum from his personal assets for the 
establishment of an educational institution of the kind he envisioned.

<p>
In November 1889, Governor Richardson signed the bill accepting Thomas Clemson's gift which established the 
Clemson Agricultural College, with its trustees becoming custodians of Morrill Act and Hatch Act funds made 
available for agricultural education and research purposes by federal legislative acts.
</p>

<p>
Although he also is remembered today for other accomplishments, Thomas Clemson made his greatest historical 
contribution when his life became intertwined with the destiny of educational and economic development in South 
Carolina. Although he never lived to see it, his dedicated efforts culminated in the founding of Clemson 
Agricultural College of South Carolina.
</p>

<p>
Clemson College formally opened in July 1893 with an enrollment of 446. From the beginning, the college was an 
all-male military school. It remained this way until 1955 when the change was made to "civilian" status for 
students and Clemson became a coeducational institution. In 1964 the college was renamed Clemson University as 
the state Legislature formally recognized the school's expanded academic offerings and research pursuits.
