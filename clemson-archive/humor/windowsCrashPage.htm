Prayer
---------
Dear Lord,
Every evening as I'm lying here in bed
This tiny little prayer keeps running through my head
God bless my mom and dad and bless my little pup
And look out for my sister when things aren't looking up.

And God, there's one more thing I wish that you could do
Hope you don't mind me asking, but please bless my computer too?
Now I know that's not normal to bless a mother board
But just listen a second while I explain to you 'My Lord'

You see, that little metal box holds more to me than odds & ends
Inside those small compartments rest a hundred of my 'BEST FRIENDS'
I know for sure they like me by the kindness that they give
And this little scrap of metal is how I travel to where they live.

By faith is how I know them, much the same as you
I share in what life brings them from that our friendship grew
"PLEASE" Take an extra minute from your duties up above
To bless this scrap of metal that's filled with so much love!
</pre>
