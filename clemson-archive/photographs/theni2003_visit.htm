	<h4>Introduction:</h4>
	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		Andipatty is in Theni district and is 450 kms south of Chennai (Madras). The easiest way to get 
		there from Chennai is to reach Madurai by train (Pandyan Express) and then take 
		the road to Andipatty which is approximately 2 hours(~70 kms) away. 
	</p></div>

	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
	   	A look at last year's report by Harikiran[1] will give you some general statistics of the 
		town of Andipatty. Further information is available at the official webpage[2] maintained by 
		the National Informatics Center. This dusty town is significant politically since it happens 
		to be the constituency of the current state Chief Minister J. Jayalalitha in this politically 
		charged state of Tamil Nadu. There are some government run development programs here (see 
		District Rural Development Agency in [2]). However I am unable to comment on them due to 
		my lack of knowledge of their details. The purpose of my visit was to be two fold: to get 
		educated about the activities of the volunteers here, and to provide input to AID-Clemson 
		group on how best we can interface with the volunteers here constructively. My meeting with 
		Dr Balaji Sampath (AID Chennai) a few days prior to my visit to Andipatty had given me a good idea about the 
		status of HBP program in the district. Readers are advised to read my report[3] on the meeting 
		as it gives some very good ideas on where AID Clemson can contribute in the HBP program.  
	</p></div>
	   
	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		The workers at Andipatty are from TNSF (Tamil Nadu Science Forum) ranks. The AID/TNSF office is 
		housed in the AISECT Computer Center which is a well known landmark near the bus station. Here is 
		the postal address for our records: <br>
		<br>
		<i>TNSF/Vaigai Magalir Iyyakkam<br>
		8-2/310 Nethaji Nagar,<br>
		Railway Feeder Rd,<br>
		Andipatty, Theni District 625512<br>
		Tamil Nadu, India</i>
	</p></div>

	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		I had informed Mr Ramakrishnan, the TNSF District Secretary for Theni about my arrival a few days in 
		advance. I reached the office at around 9:30AM. A short young lady cheerfully introduced herself as 
		Veerithai and led me in. About 8 women, whom I later learnt were from some of the Self Help Groups(SHG), 
		were holding court and the office was busy with activity. Amidst all the heavy conversation I was 
		introduced to two other volunteers Mr Chinnadi and Mr Rajendran.
	</p></div>

	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		As a means of promoting self-employment the TN government sponsors vocational training of women from 
		the economically weaker sections under the Enterpreneurship Development program, which is officially a 
		part of the 'Magalir Thittam' scheme. When I arrived at the office Mr Rajendran was busy distributing 
		certificates to women who had successfully completed their training. He informed me that approximately 
		125 local women have been trained so far in various vocational skills such as soap-making and candle-making.
	</p></div>

	<br><b><font size=-1>photo 2: A sample certificate awarded by the TN goverment in the EDP program</font></b></center>
	
	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		My agenda for the day included a visit to T-subalapuram which was supposed to be the most backward village 
		in the block, followed by a visit to Maniakarranpatti village to witness a demonstration of how the volunteers 
		conducted the health program (Arogya Iyakkam) and to meet with some representatives of the women's groups 
		(Magalir Iyakkam). Thanks to regular contact between Aarthi (AID-Clemson) and Ms Veerithai almost every weekend, 
		the folks at Andipatty had an idea of what we were looking for in my visit. This was indeed helpful since I 
		realized soon enough that my grasp of tamil was inadequate to hold long, meaningful and indepth conversation 
		with people here. Speaking broken tamil generously mixed with english words simply didn't work as expected!. 
		Note that in future such project visits should preferably be undertaken by AID volunteers with a strong grasp 
		over the local language of the people, even if the volunteers at the project site understand and speak english. 
		This is imperative if we wish to gain maximum advantage out of such visits both for us as well as for the 
		volunteers working at the block. There were many instances later on in the day when I had to remain passive 
		because I couldn't understand the conversation around me or couldn't convey my thoughts effectively to the 
		people. Some of the inaccuracies that readers may find in this report can be attributed to this language 
		problem, although I have tried to verify anything I state here as fact.
	</p></div>

	<h4>Visit to T-subalapuram village:</h4>
	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		First on the agenda was a visit to T-subalapuram. The village is connected by public transport and is a fifteen 
		minute ride from the AID office. All along the ride, tamil movie songs playing over the radio in the background was 
		a great comfort from the inconvenience of the scorching summer heat and the rising dust around the bus as it meandered 
		its way through the barren landscape with the western ghats far in the horizon.
	</p></div>

	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		There are about 25 handloom and powerloom units in T-subalapuram. According to Mr Chinnadi, who accompanied me to this 
		village along with Ms Veerithai and three other volunteers whose names I have shamelessly forgotten, weaving, or 'Nasavu Thari' 
		is pretty much the only occupation in this village. Sarees made here are sent to Coimbatore and places in Kerala. In my 
		conversation with one of the workers in a loom I learnt that he earns about Rs 100 (per week?) and his productivity is about 
		five sarees a month, each worth about Rs 400. The most disappointing fact is that all these units employ child labour. 
		Some units employ children as young as eight years of age. There are families who borrow upto Rs 500 from the factory 
		owners and work here in return for the monetary help. In one of these units I was introduced to a teenaged girl who 
		was also a 'Thondar'. 'Thondars' are voluntary social workers selected from the village 'Iyakkam' (committee, see index) 
		formed with the help of full-time volunteers. Barely audible above the noise of the machines running endlessly around us, 
		she told me how she goes door to door educating the folks in her village about issues such as pregnancy care and child health.
	</p></div>

	<br><b><font size=-1>photo 3: Looms here employ young children, mostly girls as workers</font></b></center>

	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		Recognizing that child labour is more a result of social pressures of the poor than a crime, the volunteers will soon be 
		starting night classes for these children. The aim is to provide atleast a basic level of education. Kids here in general 
		want to study. Some of them go to school and work in these looms only during the summer vacation. About a thousand children 
		are employed in various units around this town. Child labour is the principle problem that needs to be addressed here.
	</p></div>

	<br><b><font size=-1>photo 4: One of the kids employed in a powerloom. She says she works here only 
	during summer vacations.</font></b></center>

	
	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		This is a very sensitive issue and will require a lot of courage, research and hardwork to tackle effectively. In an email 
		from Dr Balaji Sampath after my project visit he explained about how their earlier campaign against child labour in one region 
		met with stiff resistance from the association of owners of match factories. Currently AID does not have an action plan to 
		fight this problem. This is one potential area where we (AID-Clemson) can help by setting up a team of volunteers who can 
		research into the factors that give rise to child labour and its consequences. With guidance from organizations such as the 
		International Labour Organization (ILO) we can work towards a program that will aim at total elimination of child labour. I 
		do not know how we are going to do this but we should try. India has the largest number of child labourers in the world. We 
		dream of a strong and developed India that is a knowledge society and a technological superpower. The dream will not come true 
		if a large number of potentially talented but poor children do not even get the opportunity to develop their physical and psychological 
		capabilities to lead a productive and happy adult life. Such children will, as adults, contribute far less than their potential to 
		the economic development of the country and hence this problem is like a rot in our society that requires sincere attention.
	</p></div>

	<br><b><font size=-1>photo 5: Child labour is the principle problem that needs to be addressed here</font></b></center>

	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		Apart from the looms, we also visited some stone quarries run by some Women's SHGs (Self-Help Groups). These quarries make gravel for roads and grinding 
		stones used in south Indian kitchens (called 'Attu-kallu' and 'Ammi-kallu'). Boulders are brought down from the nearby hills and hand 
		tools are used to break them down into various products. I witnessed no automation of any sort. Income from this labour intensive occupation 
		is about Rs 1200 a month. I was informed that government tenders give priority for products from such Magalir (Women's) groups.
	</p></div>

	<br><b><font size=-1>photo 6: A stone quarry run by a Self-Help Group(SHG)</font></b></center>
	
	<h4>AISECT Computer Center:</h4>
	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		It was past noon when we returned to the TNSF office from T-subalapuram. The office was busy with a new bunch of women all voicing 
		their grievances about some issue I couldn't grasp. Apparently the women belonged to SHGs. One of the ladies in the group told me about 
		a similar visit from an AID volunteer a couple of years back and the appreciation she received for the work done by her SHG.
	</p></div>

	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		As mentioned earlier, the AID office also doubles up as the computer center. Currently about 20 women are being trained here in DTP 
		(Desk Top Publishing) in a state government funded program, besides the usual courses in computer programming languages. The computer 
		center is in dire need of working equipment. The center has four computers, only two of them being in operating condition. The computers 
		they use here are Pentium based machines with modest capabilities and they apparently serve the purpose. They run all kinds of commercial 
		software that could normally be found in any software training institute. However none of these software products are licensed. This must 
		be changed. As a first step we could contact the vendors of these software titles to grant us free licenses for use in such sites. If 
		this fails, we could look for alternatives such as GNU/Linux[4] that are free and usually have equal or better standards of quality. 
		When I met Mr Ramakrishnan later in the evening, he also expressed a desire to try alternatives and I promised that I would send him 
		a copy of the GNU/Linux Operating System for trial at their computer center when I get back to Clemson. 
	</p></div>

	<h4>Visit to Maniakarranpatti village:</h4>
	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		Next on the agenda was a visit to Maniakarranpatti village. This village is ten minutes away by the local bus. Here the volunteers 
		demonstrated how they go around talking to people about health issues as a part of the Health Awareness Campaign (Arogya Iyakkam).
	</p></div>
	
	<center><img src="theni2003_visit/health_campaign.jpg" width="640" height="363" border="0" alt="health campaign">
	<br><b><font size=-1>photo 7: A health volunteer talks to a mother about child health care.</font></b></center>

	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		Besides AID, there are two foreign Christian missionaries here working in the area of health awareness. Back in the TNSF office Ms Veerithai 
		showed me the health records they maintained from all the surveys in the block. The health records maintained by the volunteers here are 
		apparently more accurate than the those from the government. For the benefit of the volunteers at AID-Clemson, I am bringing along a copy 
		of these health records.
	</p></div>

	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		During my visit to Maniakarranpetti, I also had the opportunity to take part in a meeting with women from some of the Self-Help Groups.
	</p></div>

	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		The term Self-Help Group has appeared often in this report, and for the benefit of readers who aren't aware of the concept, 
		here is a small introduction to it. A SHG consists of about 15-20 local residents, usually women. The idea is to encourage monthly 
		saving among the members of the group and circulate their savings among the needy members of the group through low-interest loans. 
		This is also called 'Microcredit' and has been found effective in satisfying the credit requirements of the poor, as opposed to loans 
		from banks. It also saves the poor from the clutches of perennial indebtedness due to high interest rates from exploitative money-lenders. 
		An article titled 'Microcredit and its role in poverty alleviation' authored by K. Kalpana on the AIPSN webpage[5] gives an excellent 
		introduction to the concept of Microcredit and SHGs. Interested readers are strongly encouraged to read this article in order to 
		appreciate the benefits that such groups can bring to a poor community. SHGs also unite the women into strong coherent groups that 
		the local government simply cannot ignore. They have potential watchdog qualities and are quick to act against social problems such 
		as alcoholism and abusive husbands, and non-responsive civic authorities. A sense of social resposibility grows among the members of 
		such groups and they grow in strength by helping more and more women in the neighbourhood. The members of these groups meet monthly 
		to talk about various issues affecting their community. Kalpana's article explains the positive changes that have been brought about 
		by the 550 SHGs initiated by the Tamil Nadu Science Forum in Kanyakumari district. From an earlier telephonic conversation between 
		Aarthi and Ms Veerithai, it was learnt that Andipatty has about 167 such women's groups.
	</p></div>

	<center><img src="theni2003_visit/womens_meet.jpg" width="640" height="239" border="0" alt="Women's group meeting">
	<br><b><font size=-1>photo 8: A women's group meeting in progress.</font></b></center>

	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		SHGs can also start their own small-scale enterprise (Siru Thozhil) with loans of upto Rs 25000 from the government. All the members of 
		the group contribute a small amount monthly in order to pay back the loan. They were asked how these loans have changed their lives. Some 
		were able to start small enterprises of their own and hence have a sustained income. One of the women was able to pay off all her debts 
		and take care of her diseased husband, while yet another woman was able to support the education of her children. It was found that some 
		groups slack after they have been sanctioned loans. Ms Veerithai advised them on the importance of minimum monthly payments to keep such 
		programs running efficiently. These groups require constant motivation and encouragement so that they keep meeting regularly and remain 
		an effective force for social change. 
	</p></div>

	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		It was about 4:00 PM when we decided to return to the TNSF office. At the office I had the pleasure of meeting Mr Ramakrishnan who happened 
		to be busy for most of the day. I was also given samples of products developed by the Women's groups, such as detergent powder, soaps, 
		candles, etc. I am bringing these back to Clemson, along with an encouraging recent local newspaper report on the work done by Vaigai 
		Magalir Iyyakkam and a copy of 'Arivu Thendral', a booklet on social issues developed by TNSF. 
	</p></div>

	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		I spent another hour in the TNSF office, took a photograph of the people working at the office here and headed back to Madurai by bus. 
		Before leaving I also left a questionaire with questions motivated towards how we can help the team and their work better. I am looking 
		forward to receiving the completed questionaire by mail sometime soon.
	</p></div>

	<h4>Impressions:</h4>
	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		A note here on the competance of the volunteers working at Andipatty. I am impressed by their commitment to their cause, inspite of all 
		the challenges they have to face. The full-time volunteers here are very well informed allrounders who can speak fluetly to the local 
		people on any issue that they have been trained to tackle. They are good at implementing policies and believe in their work. They receive 
		periodic training through district and state level workshops. They have a genuine concern towards issues such as plastic waste and pollution. 
		As a human being we can display two kinds of behavior when faced with a difficult problem. Either we are mere bystanders and victims of 
		happenings in our surroundings, or we are actors who have the courage to face the problem head on. The volunteers at Andipatty would belong 
		to the second category. I would like to let the readers at Clemson be known that this is a great team to work with.
	</p></div>

	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		Yet another beautiful realization that struck me in my visits to rural areas has been the kindness and hospitality of the local people. 
		The folks here will go out of their way to make sure that a visitor has a pleasant experiance. The team at Andipatty took care of all my 
		travelling expenses within their town inspite of my strong disapproval. I was offered food everywhere I went and I was treated with more 
		respect than I deserve even by people who were a lot older than I am.
	</p></div>

	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		Villages in Andipatty are not the most backward I have seen so far. The places here seem to be well connected by public transport. 
		Andipatty itself is like any other relatively well developed town near big cities such as Chennai. There is an internet cafe right 
		outside the TNSF office here and I had to work hard to suppress my desire to go check for any e-mails, an obsessive disorder that 
		displays its symptoms every few minutes when I am in Clemson. There is also a railway line going through the town.
	</p></div>

	<br><b><font size=-1>photo 10: Bye bye!!.</font></b></center>
	
	<h4>Conclusions:</h4>
	<div style="text-align:justify;"><p>
		It is important to realize the amount of potential that organizations such as AID have in the larger objective of nation building[6,7]. 
		What makes a country great is its people and their attitude. People are the asset. Organizations such as AID contribute immensely towards 
		'value addition' to this asset at the grassroots level. What we need is the belief that we can create a change and contribute towards the vision of a developed 
		India. SHGs are doing a wonderful job in bringing a positive attitude to the lives of many people. We have to do more. A developed India 
		is our right. We are the lucky ones among a billion who have received a good education and a great standard of living. We are the privileged 
		few, and with our educational assets we have a responsibility to initiate a change. I would like to stress on this point, and so, let 
		me say this again: We have a responsibility to initiate a positive change towards a developed India.
