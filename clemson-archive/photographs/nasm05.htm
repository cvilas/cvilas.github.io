<i>Space Shuttle: The First 20 Years - The Astronauts' Experiences in Their Own Words</i> (Hardcover)
by DK Publishing (ISBN: 0789484250). Bought this one for $40 at the museum store. I later found that 
this is available for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0789484250/102-5630109-4056941?v=glance&n=283155&n=507846&s=books&v=glance">
$15 at Amazon</a>. That doesn't hurt at all if a part of the sales contribute to 
the maintainence of artifacts in this museum. Entry to this museum is free, and that's more 
than what a person like me could ever wish for. Reading this book inspired me to learn more 
about NASA's research into manned space flight. I ended up getting 
"<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0963397451/102-5630109-4056941?v=glance&n=283155&n=507846&s=books&v=glance">Space Shuttle: 
The History of the National Space Transportation System : The First 100 Missions</a></i>" 
(ISBN: 0963397451) by Dennis R. Jenkins. This book covers the technical history behind research into 
re-usable space vehicles. This is a wonderful resource that any engineer interested in 
learning the history of space vehicles would love to have.

Apart from the various aircrafts and spacecrafts on display, the museum also has various 
related artifacts, such as missiles, space suits, enabling technologies such as old mainframe 
computers, and an IMAX theatre.
