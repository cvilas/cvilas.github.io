<i>Jul 19, 2003</i><br>
I have spent a decent amount of time this summer thinking about the direction in which I should take my research as 
a PhD student. This <a href="teachingResearchGuideSummer03.htm" style="text-decoration:none">first version</a> should help me plan my next couple of years.

<b>Mission in life</b><br>
What is the purpose of my life? What am I trying to achieve. Will I have achieved something unique and important before I die? Will my story be worth telling someone. Most of us lead ordinary lives. We plan our lives just enough to lead an ordinary life, and we mostly think only about ourselves - better grades, graduation, and a job that pays us decently. How about having a mission. How about working towards a goal that is worthy of being pursued, even worth dying for. What kind of a mission should that be?

<b>Why Robotics</b><br>
I often wondered why my grandmother knows more than me about nature - the seasons, the position of stars, the wildlife around us. 
She hardly had any formal education worth talking about and I am a Master's student, on my way to a PhD.

<b>Chaos-Making of a New Science, by James Gleick</b><br>
I can't believe I didn't get a hold on this book any earlier. Although the subject is highly mathematical, the book isn't. 
However it is beautifully written for the beginner, with plenty of references for further reading. Thanks to my rotten memory 
I realize that making notes for future reference is important. Who knows may be I will have a 'eureka' moment someday while going 
through them again. <a href="chaosGleick.htm" style="text-decoration:none">My notes on this book</a>.

<b>Selfish Altruism:</b><br>
Why do we help each other when we have so much to gain by cheating on others? It so happens that altruistic nature of living 
beings is not selfless after all. This is a behavior that is built into our evolutionary mechanism and may be 
<a href="selfishAltruism.htm" style="text-decoration:none">essential for our survival</a>.
