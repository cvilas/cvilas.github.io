Blame it on my serotonin levels (or is it sheer laziness?), but my productivity had hit a new all time low this summer and I had to do something about it. Across the hall, Vijay seemed 
equally bored with life. So was KT, who had not been on a single roadtrip since he landed in this country. Good. Now I had company! A trip to 
Charleston seemed an exciting idea for a quick break. Located along the Atlantic coast, Charleston (South Carolina) is only 250 miles from Clemson 
(or approximately 5 hours of driving, mostly on Interstate-26). The city is more than 300 years old (original settlement was established in 1670) and 
therefore has a rich history. Among other major events, the first gun shots of the <a href="http://sunsite.utk.edu/civil-war/" style="text-decoration:none">
American Civil War (1861-65)</a> were fired here (Fort Sumter).

<center><h4>Preparations for the trip</h4></center>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
Searches on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&q=charleston" style="text-decoration:none">Google</a> revealed a few 
<a href="http://www.charlestoncvb.com/" style="text-decoration:none">interesting websites</a> hosting information about Charleston. 
The list of places to visit included the Naval and Maritime Museum at Patriots Point, the plantations (the backbone of agrarian economy of the south during 1800s),
 the Aquarium and many historical buildings. Since a one day trip was not feasible, we also needed a place to stay overnight in the city. At only $46 a night, Ramada Inn 
 was the cheapest hotel we could find on the internet. With a visit to 
<a href="http://www.mapquest.com/directions/main.adp?go=1&do=nw&ct=NA&1ah=&1a=&1p=&1c=clemson&1s=sc&1z=&1y=US&2ah=&2a=&2p=&2c=charleston&2s=sc&2z=&2y=US&lr=2&x=17&y=12" style="text-decoration:none">Mapquest</a>,
 we had the driving instructions and we were all set. We decided to leave at 4 AM the next morning (Saturday june 29th, 2002). I overslept (!), so we left at 5:30 AM instead. 
There is nothing spectacular about the drive to Charleston. Unlike my <a href="trekElkmont.htm" style="text-decoration:none">last year's drive to Elkmont</a> which was scenic all the way, 
the drive to Charleston was quite uninteresting. We made it to the city in just over four hours of driving.

<center><h4>Patriot's Point</h4></center>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>
Our first stop was at <a href="http://www.state.sc.us/patpt/" style="text-decoration:none">Patriot's point</a> located on Charleston Harbor in Mount Pleasant, at the 
foot of Cooper River Bridges. This is the world's largest Naval and Maritime museum and home of WW II's <a href="http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ships/carriers/histories/cv05-yorktown/cv05-yorktown.html" style="text-decoration:none">

Also on display are <a href="http://www.maritime.org/hnsa-ss343.htm" style="text-decoration:none">submarine <b>Clamagore</b></a>, <a href="http://www.maritime.org/hnsa-laffey.htm" style="text-decoration:none">
destroyer <b>Laffey</b></a> and <a href="http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/history/Ingham_Colbert_Carter.html" style="text-decoration:none">Coast Guard cutter <b>Ingham</b></a>, along with vintage military aircraft and weapons. The living and working 
areas of ships are open to the general public. At $12 per head, the tickets are a little pricey but if you have never been inside a naval vessel before, this is worth it.
</p>


<p>
USS Yorktown was named after a small town in Virginia that was the site of the final battle that won the United States it's independence from Great Britain. 
The first ship named Yorktown was a US Navy Sloop of War built in 1838. She was 117 feet long and 34 feet wide and armed with sixteen 32 pounder guns. The most famous
 was probably the third USS Yorktown, the aircraft carrier CV 5 that fell victim to Japanese Kamikaze attacks during WW II. On display at the Patriot's Point is the fourth USS
 Yorktown, the aircraft carrier CV 10, an Essex class ship, commissioned 13, April 1943. (Note: the "V" in CV-10 is the navy's symbol for heavier-than-air craft, as opposed 
to "Z" for lighter-than-air blimps.) The ship and her crew stared in the 1944 war documentary 'The Fighting Lady', 
which became the ship's knick-name, and won an Academy Award. The hour long documentary is shown on board daily at 10am, noon, 2pm and 4pm. (More on <a href="http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ships/carriers/" style="text-decoration:none">US Navy aircraft carriers</a>.)

<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>
One of the most popular aircraft displays on the carrier is the F-14A Tomcat. Prominently featured in the movie "Top Gun" 
(my personal favorite. Did anybody else around here watch the movie more than 6 times?!), 
the F-14A Tomcat saw action during the Persian Gulf War. The Grumman built "swing-wing" air superiority fighter is capable of speeds over Mach 2 (twice the 
speed of sound), is crewed by a pilot and a naval flight officer and carries a wide array of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons. The Tomcat's 
electronic systems can track 24 targets at great distances and engage six simultaneously. It's total armament capacity is approximately 14,500 pounds, 
including the M61 20mm cannon located on the port side of the aircraft near the cockpit. A heavy plane (up to 72,000 pounds at take-off), the F-14A can 
remain in the air up to four hours with an internal fuel capacity near 2400 gallons and longer if re-fueled in flight. The range is however greatly 
reduced during combat operations. Although still in service (since 1972, expected to be in service until early in 21st century), it is no longer in 
production and is being supplanted by the F-18 Hornet.

We spent more than an hour inside the Yorktown, exploring almost all the important sections of the vessel. The submarine Clamagore (SS-343) was next. The plaque 
near SS-343 says the 1800 ton <i>Balao</i> class WW II sub was decommissioned as one of the last diesel powered subs in 1975 and brought to Patriot's Point in 1981.
 It has 10 torpedo tubes and was manned by a crew of 8 officers and 72 men. She spent her 30-year career operating out of Key West, Charleston, and New England, Conn., 
 modified first to Guppy II and then to Guppy III (<a href="http://guppysubmarinetribute.homestead.com/History.html" style="text-decoration:none">GUPPY History</a>), 
 the final configuration attained by diesel powered submarines before the introduction of nuclear submarines.

The insides of a submarine can be pretty claustrophobic. With hardly any space to move around, all you see are pipes, dials and gauges around you.

It was about 1:30 in the afternoon and we had enough of ships for the day. The scorching heat and humidity of the coast had drained most of our energy and therefore 
none of us really cared much for the other two ships nearby, the Coast Guard Cutter Ingham and the Destroyer Laffey.

It was time for some innocent shopping for souvenirs at the nearby gift shop. I got myself a kit to build a scaled model of the aircraft carrier 
<a href="charleston/cvn71.jpg"  style="text-decoration:none">USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71)</a>. Yoohoo!. 
Thanks to instructions in Japanese and a large number of tiny pieces in the kit, building the ship kept me busy most of my next weekend. <a href="charleston/cvn71Kit.jpg"  style="text-decoration:none">Here is the result!</a>.

It was well past 2 pm in the afternoon when we left Patriot's Point. We checked into our hotel and spent the rest of the afternoon dozing. In the evening, 
we spent some time looking through the various tourist brochures that we collected at Patriot's Point, trying to make up our mind on what to do next. Vijay was in 
a mood for some adventure and made a few calls to find out about jet skiing and para-sailing. Since I didn't know any swimming, I wasn't so keen on it. Anyway due to 
some reason (too expensive, no interest??) we just dropped the idea. We decided to head for Folly Beach instead. The Ghost Walk sounded pretty exciting too. So that 
was it - Folly Beach and Ghost Walk for the evening.
</p>
</div>

<center><h4>Folly Beach</h4></center>

<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>
To get to Folly Beach you have to cut across John's Island, driving mostly on SC 171.  The drive took us approximately 20 minutes. We reached Folly Beach at around 6pm. 
The landscape reminded me of Myrtle Beach, also in South Carolina. Interestingly the sand in this beach is much finer than what
I had seen before (atleast in Chennai, India where I spent 4 years before leaving for US), almost like dry cement powder both in color and size of the grains.
We walked along the ocean for some time, the constant cold wind blowing on our faces. Besides a couple of people dancing to the tunes of a small band playing nearby, nothing much was happening around. Quite surprising 
for a weekend.    
</p>

<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>
Unfortunately all the humidity and the day long driving had started taking its toll on me. I was having second thoughts about the Ghost Walk. With a heavy headache 
that felt like somebody pounding on my head with a sledge-hammer, I was about to give up for the day. We left the sea shore after dusk and a few missed highway intersections 
later we were at Ruby Tuesday for dinner. It was about 8:30pm. If we wanted to make it for the Ghost Walk, we had to be back in Charleston by 9:30 pm.

<center><h4>The Ghost Walk</h4></center>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>
We got back to Charleston in time for the Ghost Walk. It must be mentioned that this is a popular attraction and hence reservations are required. 
We had reserved for the 9:30pm slot. The tickets cost $10 per head. Although the pain in my head was now severe, Vijay talked me into going for it anyway. 
</p>

<p>
So here's the deal. A guide takes you (and about 20 others) through historic "Charles towne’s" most infamous haunted locations by candlelight; 
telling tales about the lives of people who used to live in the old city, giving you a glimpse into their society and culture. You get to hear 
stories of greed, deceit, lost love, hanged pirates, voodoo curses and alleyway duels. You feel like you are part of an hour long documentary. It was a 
unique experiance. 
</p>

<p>
No. We didn't see any ghosts! Probably they were tired of putting up routine appearances for the tourists three times a day, everyday! 
</p>

<p>
We returned to our hotel at around midnight. Long day indeed!. We hadn't seen enough of Charleston yet. We were yet to explore the downtown or 
visit plantations, aquarium and historic buildings. However we didn't have any energy to think about all that right then. We just wanted some sleep. Atleast I did.

Sunday morning Vijay was up early, watching the Soccer World Cup 2002 finals between Brazil and Germany on television (Brazil won the World Cup). 
I slept blissfully until about 9am. Over breakfast we decided to visit the aquarium, and for lunch we decided to track down the Indian restaurant
 that our Ghost Walk guide was talking about the previous day. Since I had to work in school that evening, we were to leave Charleston late afternoon, 
 and hence there was not much scope for visiting any more places.

<center><h4>The Aquarium and the IMAX Theatre</h4></center>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>
The <a href="http://206.74.146.33/scaquarium/scaweb/index.htm" style="text-decoration:none">South Carolina Aquarium</a> is one of the most visited 
places in Charleston. There are over 60 exhibits located throughout the Aquarium, with five major regions of the Appalachian Watershed as the focus: 
the Mountains, the Piedmont, the Coastal Plain, the Coast and the Ocean. The institution houses more than 10,000 creatures including river otters, 
snakes, turtles, birds, jellyfish and sharks. Some are rare and exotic. A special attraction of this aquarium is that a lot of the creatures are housed
inside special touch tanks that are open at the top, where you can put your hand in and feel the different species of plant and animal life inside the 
water. This is a pretty amazing place to visit. We spent more than an hour inside the aquarium.
</p>
</div>
<center><img src="charleston/aquarium.jpg" width="600" height="529" border="0" alt="the aquarium">
<br><b><font size=-1>Pictures from the aquarium. What's a parrot doing here?</font></b></center>
<br>

<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>
Right next to the aquarium is the <a href="http://www.charlestonimax.com/" style="text-decoration:none">Charleston IMAX theatre</a>. (The only other IMAX theatre 
in S.C. is at Myrtle Beach.) The <a href="http://www.imax.com/innovations/theatre/index.html" style="text-decoration:none">IMAX film format</a> is much larger 
than the 70mm film used in conventional theatres. The large screen fills a viewer's angle of vision completely, giving the viewer the illusion of 'being there'. 
Combine this with over 12,000 watts of audio and the illusion is complete. We watched the 1 o'clock show named 'Mysteries of Egypt', an hour long documentary 
about the civilization of ancient Egypt. The theatre was also showing a 3D documentary on the International Space Station. We missed that one because of inconvenient 
screening times. That would have been a beautiful program to watch. 
</p>

<p>
Well there was only one more thing to do in Charleston; have lunch at the Indian restaurant. We had the address to the restaurant from telephone directory 
in our hotel room. Unfortunately when we got there, we learnt that the restaurant had moved to Seattle a couple of months back. Sad.

<p>
It was 2:30 in the afternoon and it was time to start driving back to Clemson. A couple more photographs of the downtown, a box of <i>Lindt</i> chocolates for the folks back home
 and we were on our way back. This is a beautiful city. The streets are beautiful and the colonial architecture of buildings are a feast to the eyes. We missed the plantations and
 the historical buildings such as Fort Sumter. Well maybe some other time!
